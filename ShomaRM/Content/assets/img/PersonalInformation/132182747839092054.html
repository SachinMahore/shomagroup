                <p style="font-size:medium"><b>The rental application fee per applicant and co-applicant is $135 and is non-refundable.  If a Guarantor is provided, the Guarantor must also complete an application and pay a non-refundable fee of $150</b> Because there are no exceptions, it is important that you review this document carefully before applying, making certain that to the best of your knowledge you meet the rental qualifications shown below. </p>
                <p style="font-size:medium">Additionally, we want to make sure you are happy with your decision to join our community, so we put together this list of Rules and Policies created to ensure a safe and enjoyable environment for all residents.
